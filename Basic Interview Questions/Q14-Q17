Q14. What is the usage of the super keyword in Java?
    The super keyword in Java is used to refer to the parent class. It can be used
    to:
    1.​ Call the constructor of the parent class.
    2.​ Access the parent class’s methods and variables when they are
    overridden in a subclass.
    3.​ Differentiate between methods and attributes of the parent and child
    class when they have the same name.

Q15. What do you mean by the final keyword?
    The final keyword is used to restrict modifications in Java. It can be applied
    in three contexts:
    1.​ Final variable: Its value cannot be changed once assigned.
    2.​ Final method: Prevents method overriding in subclasses.
    3.​ Final class: Prevents inheritance by other classes.

Q16. How is an exception handled in Java?
    Java handles exceptions using the try-catch-finally mechanism:
    1.​ Try block: Contains the code that might generate an exception.
    2.​ Catch block: Handles the exception and defines what should be done
    when an error occurs.
    3.​ Finally block: Executes regardless of whether an exception occurs or
    not, often used for resource cleanup (e.g., closing files or database
    connections).
Q17. How can objects in a Java class be prevented from
serialization?
    Serialization converts an object into a byte stream for storage or
    transmission. To prevent serialization:
    1.​ Declare fields as transient to exclude them from serialization.
    2.​ Implement writeObject() and readObject() methods to control
    serialization.
    3.​ Extend NotSerializableException to explicitly prevent serialization.
