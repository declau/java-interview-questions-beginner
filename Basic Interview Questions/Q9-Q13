Q9. What is function overriding?
    Overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a
    method defined in its superclass. It enables dynamic method dispatch
    (runtime polymorphism).

Q12. What do you mean by singleton class?
    A singleton class ensures that only one instance of the class exists throughout
    the application's lifecycle. It is implemented using a private constructor, a
    static instance variable, and a public static method that returns the single

Q13. Does every try block need a catch block?
    No, a try block does not necessarily need a catch block. It can be followed by

    that may arise in the try block, while a final block ensures that certain code
