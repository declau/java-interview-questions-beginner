Q6. What are local and global variables?
    ●​ Local variables are declared inside methods or blocks and are
    accessible only within their scope.
    ●​ Global variables (also called instance variables) are declared within a
    class but outside any method and have a wider scope.

Q7. What is data encapsulation?
    Encapsulation is an OOP principle where data (variables) and code (methods)
    are bundled into a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to data using
    access modifiers (private, protected).
Q8. What is function overloading?
    Function overloading allows multiple methods to have the same name but
    different parameter lists. The compiler differentiates them based on the
    number or type of parameters.
Example:
public class Figure
{
​
    public int area(int a, int b)
    {
    int rectangleArea = a*b;
    return rectangleArea;
    }
    public int area(int a)
    {
    int squareArea = a*a;
    return squareArea;
    }
public static void main(String[] args ){
    Figure f = new Figure();
    System.out.println("Area of square " + f.area(5));
    System.out.println("Area of Rectangle " + f.area(5,3));
    }
}
