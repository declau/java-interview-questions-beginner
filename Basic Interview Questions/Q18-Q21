Q19. Why is reflection used in Java?
    Reflection in Java allows a running program to inspect and manipulate its
    methods, fields, and constructors at runtime. It is commonly used in
    frameworks, debugging tools, and JavaBeans to dynamically access class
    properties.

Q20. What are the different types of ClassLoaders in Java?
    Java provides three main types of ClassLoaders:
        1.​ Bootstrap ClassLoader: Loads core Java classes from rt.jar and other
        essential libraries. It is implemented in native code and does not have
        a Java class representation.
        2.​ Extension ClassLoader: Loads classes from the JRE/lib/ext directory or
        any other specified extension directories. It is implemented as
        sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader.
        3.​ System (Application) ClassLoader: Loads application classes from the
        classpath (defined by CLASSPATH, -cp, or -classpath options). It is a
        child of the Extension ClassLoader.

Q21. What is a copy constructor in Java?
    A copy constructor creates a new object by copying the properties of an
    existing object. It takes an instance of the same class as an argument and
    initializes the new object with the same values.
